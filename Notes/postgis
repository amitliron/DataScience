Defenitions:
SRID - spatial reference identifier  
WKT  - well known text
GIS  -  geography information system


1. CREATE TABLE cities ( id int4 primary key, name varchar(50), geom geometry(POINT,4326) );

2. ST_GeomFromText
   convert from a text format to spatial
   INSERT INTO cities (id, geom, name) VALUES (1,ST_GeomFromText('POINT(-0.1257 51.508)',4326),'London, England');

3. SELECT id, ST_AsText(geom), ST_AsEwkt(geom), ST_X(geom), ST_Y(geom) 
   FROM cities;

4. Display distances between cities in meters

   SELECT p1.name,p2.name,ST_DistanceSphere(p1.geom,p2.geom) 
   FROM cities AS p1, cities AS p2 
   WHERE p1.id > p2.id;
